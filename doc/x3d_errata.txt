-- Spec ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 --

* 15.4.2 Text (Text component)

  typo in the fontStyle field:

  SFNode   [in,out] fontStyle NULL  [X3FontSyleNode]

  X3DFontStyleNode should be instead of X3FontSyleNode.

* 25.3.5 GeoMetadata (Geospatial component)

  see second edition

-- Spec ISO/IEC 19775-1:2008 Edition 2 (ISO-IEC-FDIS-19775-1.2) --

* 11.3.2 X3DComposedGeometryNode (Rendering component)

  undefined constraint type "X3DColorObject" in the color field:
  
  SFNode [in,out] color NULL [X3DColorObject]

  Maybe typo: X3DColorNode (11.3.1) instead of X3DColorObject.
  In the previous edition of the specification there were no type restriction
  on this field.

* 15.4.2 Text (Text component)

  typo in the fontStyle field:

  SFNode   [in,out] fontStyle  NULL  [X3FontStyleNode]

  X3DFontStyleNode should be instead of X3FontStyleNode.

* 18.4.2 MovieTexture (Texturing component)

  missing pitch field:

  SFFloat  [in,out] pitch  1.0  (0,inf)

  Field pitch is declared in X3DSoundSourceNode, but is not declared in the
  MovieTexture node. MovieTexture node is derived from X3DSoundSourceNode.

* 25.3.5 GeoMetadata (Geospatial component)

  invalid constraint type "urn" in the data field:

  MFNode [in,out] data [] [urn]

* 25.3.8 GeoProximitySensor (Geospatial component)

  missing center field:

  SFVec3f [in,out] center    0 0 0 (-inf,inf)

  Field center is declared in the node X3DEnvironmentalSensorNode but is not
  declared in GeoProximitySensor node. GeoProximitySensor node is derived from
  X3DEnvironmentalSensorNode.

* 25.3.11 GeoViewpoint

  fields orientation, retainUserOffsets, centerOfRotation:

  Field orientation defined in the node X3DViewpointNode is different to the 
  declaration in the GeoViewpoint node:

    in X3DViewpointNode : SFRotation [in,out] orientation 0 0 1 0 # [-1,1],(-inf,inf)
    in GeoViewpoint : SFRotation [] orientation 0 0 1 0 # (-inf,inf) or -1 1

  Fields retainUserOffsets and centerOfRotation are declared in 
  X3DViewpointNode, but are not declared in the GeoViewpoint node.

  GeoViewpoint node is derived from X3DViewpointNode.

* 27.4.9 NurbsSet (NURBS component)

  undefined constraint type "NurbsSurface" in 
  addGeometry, removeGeometry, geometry fields:

  MFNode  [in]     addGeometry                [NurbsSurface]
  MFNode  [in]     removeGeometry             [NurbsSurface]
  MFNode  [in,out] geometry          []       [NurbsSurface]

  Possible candidate is 27.3.2 X3DNurbsSurfaceGeometryNode:

  "The X3DNurbsSurfaceGeometryNode represents the abstract geometry type for 
   all types of NURBS surfaces"

  However, only NurbsPatchSurface and NurbsTrimmedSurface are derived from
  X3DNurbsSurfaceGeometryNode, NurbsSweptSurface and NurbsSwungSurface are 
  derived from X3DParametricNode.

  Alternatively create X3DNurbsSurfaceNode and inherit 
  X3DNurbsSurfaceGeometryNode from it.

* 32.3.1 X3DProductStructureChildNode (CAD geometry component)

  missing metadata field:

  SFNode [in,out] metadata NULL [X3DMetadataObject]

  Field metadata is declared in the X3DNode, but is not declared in the
  X3DProductStructureChildNode. X3DProductStructureChildNode is indirectly 
  derived from X3DNode.

* 33.4.1 ComposedTexture3D (Texturing3D component)

  missing textureProperties field:

  SFNode []       textureProperties NULL [TextureProperties]

  Field textureProperties is declared in the X3DTexture3DNode, but is not
  declared in ComposedTexture3D node. ComposedTexture3D is derived 
  from X3DTexture3DNode.

* 38.3.2 X3DPickSensorNode (Picking component)

  undefined constraint type "X3DInlineNode" in the pickTarget field:
 
  MFNode   [in,out] pickTarget [] [X3DGroupingNode|X3DShapeNode|X3DInlineNode]

  Maybe Inline node should be derived from X3DInlineNode ?
  Currently Inline node is derived from X3DChildNode, X3DBoundedObject, 
  X3DUrlObject.

  Additionally X3DPickSensorNode is not in the node index, instead 
  there is a incorrect reference to the X3DPickingNode, which does not
  exist.

* 38.4.1 LinePickSensor (Picking component),
  38.4.3 PrimitivePickSensor (Picking component),
  38.4.5 VolumePickSensor (Picking component)

  See 38.3.2 X3DPickSensorNode.

  All nodes are derived from X3DPickSensorNode.

  Note that PointPickSensor does not have undefined constraint type
  "X3DInlineNode" in the pickTarget field.

* 38.4.4 PrimitivePickSensor

  Section is incorrectly named "PrimitivePicker" instead of PrimitivePickSensor
